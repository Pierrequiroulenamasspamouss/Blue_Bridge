    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>BlueBridge is an innovative mobile application designed to address the lack of reliable local data on water resources, particularly in rural areas and regions with limited digital infrastructure. Our mission is to facilitate the collection, transmission, and analysis of hydrological data to improve water access forecasting, management, and sustainability.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
  <p>Founded by JoÃ«l Wandege, BlueBridge emerged from the recognition that many communities lack access to basic water resource data. Without information about groundwater levels, natural reservoirs, wells, or boreholes, effective modeling or anticipation of crisis situations (drought, contamination, overexploitation) becomes impossible.</p>

  <h2>The Problem We Solve</h2>
  <p>In many regions, especially rural or technologically underserved areas, access to reliable data about water resources remains extremely limited. This information gap makes effective water management very difficult, whether for daily consumption, agriculture, or long-term planning. Groundwater tables are often not monitored, reservoirs are managed empirically, and droughts can only be anticipated once damage is already present.</p>

  <h2>Our Approach</h2>
  <p>BlueBridge offers an accessible alternative: a simple, mobile, and flexible interface designed to work offline, with understandable symbols even for users with low literacy, capable of collecting essential data through IoT sensors or manual surveys. By making this data accessible to residents themselves, as well as to NGOs, researchers, and institutions, the project aims to create a bridge between the field and decision-makers, enabling better resilience to water challenges.</p>

  <h2>Our Vision</h2>
  <p>BlueBridge envisions a world where water resource management is more accessible, collaborative, and sustainable, particularly in vulnerable or technologically isolated communities. We aim to empower users with data that can transform how communities understand and manage their water resources.</p>
