//TODO : here have a screen where you can send an urgent request not through standard internet communication, but as an SMS message to a specific number found in strings.xml. If possible, also the app to receive the response too, and this, NOT by becoming the default sms app.
// the screen should also have an option to read specific files containing data that would be sent through MMS to the user, then prompt the user to open a file, and the user could select the downloaded MMS file.
